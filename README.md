# sdpp-final-project
Angela Salacata's Final Project for CS 396 Software Design Principles and Patterns
The project is SDPP Radio- a web radio station for music lovers that provides listeners with a live radio feed and previously aired music as mixes in an archive.


# How to Spin Up
The client code is stored in the radio-poc folder. The server code is store in the radio-server folder. I uses pnpm to run the client code, and created an env virtual environment to run the server code. I used the following commands respectively:

pnpm run dev

python3 app.py

Note- for the database, persistent storage and access to the radio cult instance, I have some secret variables that I did not push to github (duh!). To replicate, you would need to create your own resources with appropriate access.
